# Mind-Map
I developed my own mind map project which is pretty useful for doing what I want. That is why I would love to share this project with other people in order to use them, have a look at them to understand the structures freely.
<br />We have good features;

<br /><strong>Panning</strong>(click middle button of your mouse on a blank area and drag the page),
<br /><strong>Zoom In/Out</strong>(scroll up/down),
<br /><strong>Changing the Theme</strong>(placed in "Settings" tab),
<br /><strong>Snapping</strong>(S or placed in "Settings" tab)
<br /><strong>Save</strong> (Ctrl+S),<br /><strong>Save As</strong> (Ctrl+Shift+S),<br /><strong>Save As PNG</strong> (no shortcut),<br /><strong>Import</strong> (Ctrl+I or shift + right button),
